Wobble is a replacement for Google Wave. It currently shares a basic feature set with google wave, but is much simpler.

Getting Started
---------------
The main-code is located at GitHub: https://github.com/ZeissS/wobble. An installation guide is located in the wiki: https://github.com/ZeissS/wobble/wiki
If you have any problem, please create an issue there as well.

Munin Plugins

See the munin-plugins/ folder for details how to install the plugins.

Tests
-----
Currently we have two sets of tests: phpunit for the server-side and some qunit tests for the client (neither are very good).

The phpunit tests are automatically run by Travis: [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ZeissS/wobble.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ZeissS/wobble)
